**Assessment Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Assessed By:** [Name / Team]  
**Overall Risk Rating:** **[LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH]**

## 📖 Purpose

This report documents the outcome of the third-party security assessment conducted as part of the onboarding process. It summarises key findings, identifies material risks, and provides a clear recommendation to support an informed approval decision.

---

## 🧭 Assessment Summary

The assessment was conducted using the Vendor Security Questionnaire and the Risk Scoring Matrix. Responses were reviewed for completeness and, where applicable, supported by evidence provided by the vendor.

The risk rating reflects both the **sensitivity of the data involved** and the **maturity of the vendor’s security controls**, rather than the presence or absence of individual certifications alone.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Strengths

- **Data Protection:** Customer data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard mechanisms.
- **Access Control:** Multi-factor authentication is enforced for users with access to customer data.
- **Operational Resilience:** Backups are performed regularly and restoration processes are defined.

### Gaps and Concerns

- **Governance:** The vendor does not currently hold independent security certification (for example ISO/IEC 27001 or SOC 2).
- **Assurance:** External penetration testing is either outdated or limited in scope.
- **Supplier Dependencies:** Use of sub-processors introduces additional supply chain risk that is not fully documented.

---

## 📊 Risk Considerations

The following factors materially influenced the overall risk rating:

- **Data Exposure:** Type and sensitivity of data processed by the vendor.
- **Control Coverage:** Presence and consistency of core security controls such as encryption, access control, and monitoring.
- **Assurance Level:** Availability of independent validation or third-party testing.
- **Operational Impact:** Potential impact to service availability or confidentiality in the event of a vendor incident.

## 🛡️ Recommendation

**Recommendation:** **[APPROVE / REJECT / CONDITIONAL APPROVAL]**

Where conditional approval is recommended, onboarding may proceed **only if** the following conditions are met:

1. **Contractual Controls:** Security clauses added to the contract, including breach notification timelines and right-to-audit provisions.
2. **Data Restrictions:** Limit processing of high-risk or sensitive data until identified gaps are addressed.
3. **Time-Bound Remediation:** Require remediation actions to be completed within an agreed timeframe.

## 🔄 Review and Reassessment

- **Next Review Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
- **Reassessment Trigger:** Material change to service, scope, or security posture.
